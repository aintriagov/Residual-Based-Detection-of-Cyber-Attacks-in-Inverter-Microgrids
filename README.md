# Residual-Based-Detection-of-Cyber-Attacks-in-Cyber-Physical-Inverter-Based-Microgrids
Implementation of a Microgrid composed by 4 DGs, where cyber-attacks are suddenly introduce into the output of the secondary controller for voltage and frequency.
With this in mind, we are going to develop a residual based detection using a non linear observer to mitigate the cyber-attacks.
